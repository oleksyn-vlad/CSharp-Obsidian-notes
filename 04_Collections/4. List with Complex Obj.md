## C# Lists with Custom Classes (Complex Objects)

In real-world applications, you rarely make lists of just `int` or `string`. You usually make lists of **Objects** created from your own classes.

The logic is the same as a `List<int>`, but now each item in the list has properties (e.g., `.Name`, `.Id`, `.Price`).

### 1. The Setup (The Class)

First, define the class that will be the type `T` for the list.

C#

```C#
public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Price { get; set; }
}
```

### 2. Declaration and Initialization

You create a `List<Product>`.

C#

```C#
// Collection Initializer (The cleanest way)
List<Product> inventory = new List<Product>
{
    new Product { Name = "Laptop", Price = 1000 },
    new Product { Name = "Mouse", Price = 25 },
    new Product { Name = "Keyboard", Price = 50 }
};
```

### 3. Iterating (Foreach)

When you loop through the list, the variable `item` is of type `Product`.

C#

```C#
foreach (Product item in inventory)
{
    // Access properties using the dot operator
    Console.WriteLine($"{item.Name} costs ${item.Price}");
}
```

### 4. Searching and Filtering (Using Lambdas)

You can search based on specific **properties** of the objects.

C#

```C#
// 1. Find all filtered items (.FindAll)
// "Find every product where the Price is greater than 30"
List<Product> expensiveItems = inventory.FindAll(p => p.Price > 30);

// 2. Find a specific single item (.Find)
// "Find the product named 'Mouse'"
Product mouse = inventory.Find(p => p.Name == "Mouse");

// 3. Check existence (.Any)
// "Do we have any product cheaper than 1 dollar?"
bool hasCheapItems = inventory.Any(p => p.Price < 1.0);
```

### 5. Removing Items

C#

```C#
// Remove all items that are too expensive
inventory.RemoveAll(p => p.Price > 500);
// 'Laptop' is now removed from the list
```

### 6. Sorting (Important!)

You **cannot** simply call `inventory.Sort()` like you do with numbers. C# does not know how to compare two `Product` objects (Is "Mouse" greater than "Laptop"?).

You must tell C# **which property** to use for comparison.

#### Method A: In-Place Sort (Modifies the list)

You pass a Lambda that compares two items (`x` and `y`).

C#

```C#
// Sort by Price (Low to High)
// We use the .CompareTo() method built into numbers/strings
inventory.Sort((x, y) => x.Price.CompareTo(y.Price));

// Sort by Name (Alphabetical)
inventory.Sort((x, y) => x.Name.CompareTo(y.Name));
```

#### Method B: LINQ OrderBy (Creates a NEW list)

This is often preferred because it is easier to read and doesn't mess up your original list.

_Requires `using System.Linq;`_

C#

```C#
// Create a NEW list ordered by Price
var sortedList = inventory.OrderBy(p => p.Price).ToList();

// Order Descending (High to Low)
var expensiveFirst = inventory.OrderByDescending(p => p.Price).ToList();
```
