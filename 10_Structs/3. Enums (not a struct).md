## C# Enums (Enumerations)

An **Enum** is a special "Value Type" that lets you define a set of named constants.

Instead of using random numbers (Magic Numbers) like `0`, `1`, `2` to represent states, you use meaningful words like `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`.

### 1. Declaration

You declare an enum directly inside the namespace (or inside a class).

By default, the first item is 0, the second is 1, and so on.

C#

```C#
public enum GameState
{
    MainMenu,  // 0
    Playing,   // 1
    Paused,    // 2
    GameOver   // 3
}
```

### 2. Usage

You use them like a variable type. This makes your code extremely readable.

C#

```C#
GameState state = GameState.Playing;

if (state == GameState.GameOver)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Try Again?");
}
```

### 3. Underlying Values (Casting)

Behind the scenes, an Enum is just an integer (int).

You can convert (cast) back and forth between the Name and the Number.

C#

```C#
public enum Day { Mon, Tue, Wed }

// Enum to Int
int dayNumber = (int)Day.Tue; 
Console.WriteLine(dayNumber); // Output: 1

// Int to Enum
Day myDay = (Day)2;
Console.WriteLine(myDay); // Output: Wed
```

### 4. Customizing Values

You don't have to start at 0. You can assign specific numbers.

C#

```C#
public enum ErrorCode
{
    None = 0,
    NotFound = 404,
    ServerBroken = 500
}

Console.WriteLine((int)ErrorCode.NotFound); // Output: 404
```

### 5. Why use Enums?

**Readability & Safety.**

- **Bad Code:** `if (status == 2)` -> What does "2" mean? Is it "Paused"? "Dead"?
    
- **Good Code:** `if (status == GameState.Paused)` -> Obvious.
    

It prevents mistakes where you might accidentally assign an invalid number (like `status = 99`).
