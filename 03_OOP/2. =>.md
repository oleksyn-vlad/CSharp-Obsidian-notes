Here is a concise summary of Expression Bodied Members for your notes.

## C# Expression Bodied Members

Expression Bodied Members are a C# shortcut that lets you write simple class members using the `=>` (lambda arrow) syntax instead of curly braces `{}`.

This makes code more concise and readable. The **only rule** is that the member's logic must be a **single expression**.

### 1. Methods

Used when a method _only_ contains a `return` statement.

C#

```C#
// Standard method (block body)
public int Square(int n)
{
    return n * n;
}

// Expression Bodied Member
// The 'return' keyword is implicit
public int Square(int n) => n * n;
```

### 2. Read-Only Properties

Used to replace a simple `get` accessor.

C#

```C#
private string _firstName = "John";
private string _lastName = "Doe";

// Standard read-only property
public string FullName
{
    get { return _firstName + " " + _lastName; }
}

// Expression Bodied property
public string FullName => _firstName + " " + _lastName;
```

### 3. Constructors

Used when a constructor _only_ has a single line, (e.g., an assignment).

C#

```C#
// Standard constructor
public Person(string name)
{
    this.Name = name;
}

// Expression Bodied constructor
public Person(string name) => this.Name = name;
```

### 4. Indexers (and Finalizers)

The same syntax can be applied to read-only indexers or finalizers.

C#

```C#
// Read-only indexer
public int this[int index] => _myArray[index];

// Finalizer
~MyClass() => Console.WriteLine("Cleaning up...");
```

### ⚠️ When NOT to Use (The Main Rule)

Expression bodies **cannot** be used for multi-line logic. If you have more than one statement, you **must** use a standard block body `{}`.

C#

```C#
// INCORRECT: This is not a single expression
public void Display() => Console.WriteLine("Hello"); Console.WriteLine("World"); // ERROR

// CORRECT (Must use a block)
public void Display()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("World");
}
```
