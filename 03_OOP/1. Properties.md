## C# Properties

A **property** is a class member that provides a flexible way to read, write, or compute the value of a **private field**.

Properties act like "gatekeepers" for your data. They look like public fields when you use them, but they are actually special methods called **accessors**.

- `get` accessor: Runs when you **read** the property's value.
    
- `set` accessor: Runs when you **assign** a value to the property. The `value` keyword holds the incoming data.
    

### 1. Full Property (with Validation)

Used when you need to add logic (like validation) to protect your private field. This is the C# equivalent of manual `Get...()` and `Set...()` methods in C++.

C#

```C#
public class Player
{
    // 1. The private "backing field"
    private int _health;

    // 2. The public "property"
    public int Health
    {
        get
        {
            return _health; // Returns the private field
        }
        set
        {
            // 'value' is the incoming data
            if (value < 0)
            {
                _health = 0; // Validation logic
            }
            else
            {
                _health = value;
            }
        }
    }
}

// How to use it:
Player p = new Player();
p.Health = -100; // 'set' accessor runs, _health becomes 0
int currentHealth = p.Health; // 'get' accessor runs
```

### 2. Auto-Property (Shortcut)

Used when you don't need any special logic. The compiler automatically creates a hidden, private backing field for you. This is the **most common** syntax.

C#

```C#
// You write this:
public string Name { get; set; }

// The compiler automatically creates this:
//
// private string _name; // (This is hidden)
// public string Name
// {
//     get { return _name; }
//     set { _name = value; }
// }
```

### 3. Expression-Bodied Properties (C# 6+)

This is a syntax shortcut for properties that only have a single line in their `get` or `set` accessor. It uses the `=>` (fat arrow) syntax, similar to lambda expressions.

This is often used with a "full property" pattern, but in a cleaner way.

C#

```C#
public class Car
{
    // Private backing field
    private string color;

    // The property using expression-bodied syntax
    public string Color
    {
        get => color;           // Shorthand for: { get { return color; } }
        set => color = value;    // Shorthand for: { set { color = value; } }
    }

    // You can also mix and match
    private string _make;
    public string Make
    {
        get => _make; // Expression body for 'get'
        set // Full body for 'set' (e.g., if you add validation)
        {
            if (value != null)
            {
                _make = value;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
