## C# Static Keyword

In C#, `static` means that a member belongs to the **class itself**, rather than to any specific object (instance) created from that class.

**Key Concept:**

- **Non-Static (Instance):** Each object has its own copy of the variable.
    
- **Static:** There is only **one copy** in memory, shared by _all_ objects of that class.
    

### 1. Static Fields & Methods

- **Static Fields:** Useful for counters or global settings.
    
- **Static Methods:** Utility functions that don't need to access specific object data. They **cannot** use the `this` keyword.
    

C#

```C#
public class Car
{
    // 1. Static Field: Shared by ALL cars
    public static int NumberOfCars = 0;

    // Instance Field: Specific to ONE car
    public string Model;

    public Car(string model)
    {
        this.Model = model;
        // Increment the shared counter
        NumberOfCars++;
    }

    // 2. Static Method: Can only access other static members
    public static void DisplayCount()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Total cars created: {NumberOfCars}");
    }
}

// --- Usage ---
// Access static members via the CLASS name, not the variable name
Car.DisplayCount(); // Output: 0

Car c1 = new Car("Tesla");
Car c2 = new Car("BMW");

// The static field updated for everyone
Car.DisplayCount(); // Output: 2
```

### 2. Static Classes

You can mark an entire class as `static`.

- It **cannot be instantiated** (you cannot use `new`).
    
- It can **only** contain static members.
    
- Perfect for utility helpers (like `System.Math`).
    

C#

```C#
public static class Calculator
{
    public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
    public static int Subtract(int a, int b) => a - b;
}

// --- Usage ---
// Calculator calc = new Calculator(); // ERROR
int sum = Calculator.Add(5, 10);
```

### 3. Static Constructor

A special constructor used to initialize static data.

- It runs **automatically** and **only once** (the first time the class is used).
    
- It has no access modifiers (no `public`) and no parameters.
    

C#

```C#
public class Database
{
    public static string ConnectionString;

    // Static Constructor
    static Database()
    {
        // Runs once to set up shared data
        ConnectionString = "Server=MyServer;Port=5432";
        Console.WriteLine("Static Config Loaded");
    }
}
```

### Summary: When to use?

|**Member Type**|**Behavior**|
|---|---|
|**Static Field**|Global variable shared by all instances (e.g., `Count`).|
|**Static Method**|Helper function, pure logic, doesn't need object state (e.g., `Math.Sqrt()`).|
|**Static Class**|A container for utility methods (cannot create objects of it).|
|**Static Ctor**|Runs once to initialize static fields.|

> **Warning:** Since static members are "global," be careful when using them in multi-threaded applications, as multiple threads might try to change the value at the same time.
