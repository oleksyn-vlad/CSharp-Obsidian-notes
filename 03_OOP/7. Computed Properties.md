## C# Computed Properties

A **Computed Property** is a property that does not store a value in a variable (field). Instead, it **calculates** its value every time you access it, usually based on other properties.

They are effectively "read-only" properties that run a small piece of logic.

### 1. The Concept

Think of Excel formulas. If column A is `Width` and column B is `Height`, column C can be `=A*B`. Column C doesn't store a static number; it calculates the result based on A and B.

In C#, a Computed Property works the same way.

### 2. Syntax (Expression Body)

We usually use the "fat arrow" syntax `=>` for computed properties because they typically contain a single line of logic.

C#

```C#
public class Rectangle
{
    // Standard Properties (Data is stored in memory)
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    // Computed Property (Data is CALCULATED on the fly)
    // 1. It has no 'set' accessor.
    // 2. It runs this math every time you call .Area
    public double Area => Width * Height;
}
```

### 3. Example: Full Name

A classic example is combining a first and last name. You don't need to store `FullName` separately; you can just compute it.

C#

```C#
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }

    // Computed Property
    // Returns a new string every time it is accessed
    public string FullName => $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
}

// --- Usage ---
Person p = new Person();
p.FirstName = "Elon";
p.LastName = "Musk";

// The calculation happens HERE, at the moment of access
Console.WriteLine(p.FullName); // Output: Elon Musk

// If we change the source data...
p.LastName = "Tusk";

// The computed property automatically reflects the change
Console.WriteLine(p.FullName); // Output: Elon Tusk
```

### 4. Computed vs. Stored Properties

|**Feature**|**Stored Property ({ get; set; })**|**Computed Property (=> ...)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Memory**|Holds a value in memory (RAM).|Uses CPU to calculate result (no extra RAM).|
|**Updates**|Must be manually updated if other data changes.|Always "up to date" because it recalculates.|
|**Usage**|Good for raw data (Name, Age).|Good for derived data (FullName, IsAdult).|

C#

```C#
public class User
{
    public int Age { get; set; } // Stored

    // Computed: Checks logic based on Age
    public bool IsAdult => Age >= 18; 
}
```
