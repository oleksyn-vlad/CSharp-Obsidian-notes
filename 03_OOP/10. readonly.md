Here is the note on the `readonly` keyword.

---

## C# Readonly Keyword

The `readonly` keyword is used to create a field that **cannot be modified** after the object is initialized.

It ensures that once a variable gets a value, it keeps that value for the entire life of the object.

### 1. When can you assign a value?

There are **only two places** you can assign a value to a `readonly` field:

1. **At Declaration:** `public readonly int x = 10;`
    
2. **Inside the Constructor:** `public MyClass() { x = 10; }`
    

Anywhere else (in methods, properties, etc.), it causes a compiler error.

### 2. Syntax Example

C#

```C#
public class Player
{
    // 1. Assigned at declaration
    public readonly int ID = 1001;
    
    // 2. Assigned in constructor (Runtime value)
    public readonly string Username;

    public Player(string name)
    {
        // Valid: We are inside the constructor
        Username = name;
    }

    public void ChangeName(string newName)
    {
        // ERROR: A readonly field cannot be assigned to 
        // (except in a constructor or a variable initializer)
        // Username = newName; 
    }
}
```

### 3. `readonly` vs. `const`

This is a common interview question.

| **Feature**         | **const**                                  | **readonly**                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **When is it set?** | **Compile Time** (Hardcoded)               | **Runtime** (Can be calculated or passed in)                |
| **Flexibility**     | Value must be known _before_ running code. | Value can be different for each object instance.            |
| **Example**         | `Math.PI`, `SpeedOfLight`                  | `BirthDate`, `AccountID`                                    |
| **Analogy**         | A printed book (content is fixed forever). | A blank ID card (write once when issuing, then it's fixed). |

C#

```C#
public class MathConstants
{
    // CONST: Must be a hardcoded value
    public const double Pi = 3.14159; 

    // READONLY: Can be calculated at runtime
    public readonly DateTime CreationTime;

    public MathConstants()
    {
        // This is allowed for readonly, but IMPOSSIBLE for const
        CreationTime = DateTime.Now; 
    }
}
```

### 4. Why use it?

- **Immutability:** It guarantees that critical data (like an ID or creation date) is never accidentally changed by a bug in your code.
    
- **Thread Safety:** Since the value doesn't change after creation, it is safer to use in multi-threaded environments.
