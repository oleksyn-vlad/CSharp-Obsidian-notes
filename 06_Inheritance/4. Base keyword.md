## C# The `base` Keyword

The `base` keyword is used in a **Derived Class** (Child) to access members of the **Base Class** (Parent).

Think of it as the opposite of `this`.

- `this` refers to the current class.
    
- `base` refers to the parent class.
    

### 1. Accessing Parent Methods

When you `override` a method, you often don't want to delete the parent's logic completely; you just want to **add** to it. You use `base.MethodName()` to run the original code first.

C#

```C#
public class Employee
{
    public virtual void StartWork()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Clocking in...");
    }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public override void StartWork()
    {
        // 1. Run the standard Employee logic first
        base.StartWork(); 
        
        // 2. Then run specific Manager logic
        Console.WriteLine("Checking emails...");
    }
}
```

### 2. Constructors (Crucial Usage)

This is the most common use case.

If the Parent class has a constructor that takes parameters (e.g., setting a Name), the Child class must call it.

You use the `: base(...)` syntax to pass data "up" to the parent.

C#

```C#
// PARENT
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Parent constructor requires a Name
    public Person(string name)
    {
        this.Name = name;
    }
}

// CHILD
public class Student : Person
{
    public int Grade { get; set; }

    // The Child constructor takes 'name' and 'grade'
    // It passes 'name' UP to the 'base' constructor
    public Student(string name, int grade) : base(name)
    {
        this.Grade = grade;
    }
}
```

### 3. Why Inheritance Matters?

1. **Code Reuse (DRY Principle):** You define common logic (like `Name`, `ID`, `Login()`) once in the Base class, and all Child classes get it for free.
    
2. **Organization:** It creates a logical hierarchy (e.g., `Vehicle` -> `Car`, `Truck`, `Bike`).
    
3. **Polymorphism:** You can treat different objects (`Dog`, `Cat`) as the same type (`Animal`) to store them in a single List or process them in a loop.
