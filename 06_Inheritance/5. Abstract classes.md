## C# Abstract Classes & Methods

An **Abstract Class** is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It acts as a **blueprint** or a "half-finished" template for other classes.

It is used when you want to define a specific structure (methods/properties) that child classes **must** have, but you also want to provide some shared, common code.

### 1. The Rules

1. **Cannot Instantiate:** You cannot write `new MyAbstractClass()`. It causes a compiler error.
    
2. **Abstract Methods:** Methods marked `abstract` have **no body** (no `{ }`). Child classes **must** override them.
    
3. **Regular Methods:** You can still have normal methods with full code. Child classes inherit these "for free".
    

### 2. Syntax Example

C#

```
// 1. The Abstract Parent
public abstract class Animal
{
    // A. Abstract Method (The "Contract")
    // It has NO body. Children MUST implement this.
    public abstract void MakeSound();

    // B. Regular Method (Shared Logic)
    // All children get this method automatically.
    public void Sleep()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Zzzzz...");
    }
}

// 2. The Concrete Child
public class Dog : Animal
{
    // We MUST override the abstract method
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark!");
    }
}

// --- Usage ---
// Animal a = new Animal(); // ❌ ERROR: Cannot create abstract class
Animal myDog = new Dog();   // ✅ OK: We create the CHILD
myDog.MakeSound();          // Output: Bark!
myDog.Sleep();              // Output: Zzzzz...
```

### 3. Abstract Class vs. Interface

This is a very common interview question.

|**Feature**|**Abstract Class**|**Interface**|
|---|---|---|
|**Inheritance**|Single (`class Dog : Animal`)|Multiple (`class Dog : IPet, IWalker`)|
|**Fields**|Can have variables (`int age;`)|**Cannot** have fields.|
|**Constructors**|Can have constructors.|**Cannot** have constructors.|
|**Methods**|Can have both abstract and real methods.|Usually only method signatures (no code).|
|**Purpose**|For closely related objects (**Is-A**).|For capabilities/contracts (**Can-Do**).|

### 4. When to use?

- **Use Abstract:** When you are building a hierarchy of **related** things (e.g., `Car`, `Truck`, `Bike` are all `Vehicle`) and they share some common logic (like `FuelLevel`) but differ in other ways (`Move()`).
    
- **Use Interface:** When unrelated classes need to do the same thing (e.g., `Dog`, `Car`, and `Robot` can all `IMove`, but they are not related).
