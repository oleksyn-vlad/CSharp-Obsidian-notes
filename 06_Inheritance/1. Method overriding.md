## C# Method Overriding (`virtual` & `override`)

**Method Overriding** allows a Child class (Derived class) to provide a **different implementation** for a method that is already defined in its Parent class (Base class).

This is the core of **Polymorphism**.

### 1. The Keywords

By default, methods in C# **cannot** be overridden. You must explicitly allow it.

- **`virtual`**: Used in the **Parent** class. It means: _"I have a default version of this method, but I allow my children to change it."_
    
- **`override`**: Used in the **Child** class. It means: _"I am replacing the parent's version with my own."_
    

### 2. Syntax Example

C#

```C#
// PARENT CLASS
public class Animal
{
    // 1. Add 'virtual' to allow overriding
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a generic sound");
    }
}

// CHILD CLASS
public class Dog : Animal
{
    // 2. Add 'override' to change the behavior
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark! Bark!");
    }
}

// CHILD CLASS 2 (Doesn't override)
public class Cat : Animal
{
    // No override here. It will use the default Animal sound.
}
```

### 3. Why is this important? (Polymorphism)

The magic happens when you treat the child object as if it were the parent type.

Even if the variable is of type `Animal`, C# is smart enough to find the **overridden** version in `Dog`.

C#

```C#
Animal myDog = new Dog();
Animal myCat = new Cat();

// Even though the variable type is 'Animal'...
// C# looks at the actual object in memory.

myDog.MakeSound(); // Output: "Bark! Bark!" (The overridden version)
myCat.MakeSound(); // Output: "Animal makes a generic sound" (The default version)
```

### 4. Extending logic with `base`

Sometimes you don't want to _replace_ the parent code, you just want to _add_ to it. You can call the parent's method using `base.MethodName()`.

C#

```C#
public class Employee
{
    public virtual void GoToWork()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Driving to office...");
    }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public override void GoToWork()
    {
        // 1. Run the original logic first
        base.GoToWork(); 
        
        // 2. Then do the extra Manager stuff
        Console.WriteLine("...and then attending meetings.");
    }
}
```

### Summary

|**Keyword**|**Location**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|---|
|**`virtual`**|Parent Class|"This method **can** be overridden."|
|**`override`**|Child Class|"I am **changing** this method."|
|**(nothing)**|Parent Class|"This method is fixed and **cannot** be changed."|
