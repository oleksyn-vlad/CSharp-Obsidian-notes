## C# Method Hiding (`new` Keyword)

Method Hiding allows a Child class to define a method with the **same name** as a Parent class method, but **without** overriding it.

It effectively "hides" the parent's version when accessed through the child class, but the parent's version still exists unchanged.

### 1. The Syntax

You use the **`new`** keyword in the Child class.

- **Note:** The parent method does **not** need to be `virtual`.
    

C#

```C#
class Parent
{
    public void Show()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Parent Show");
    }
}

class Child : Parent
{
    // The 'new' keyword tells the compiler:
    // "I know the parent has this method, but I am making a brand new one."
    public new void Show()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Child Show");
    }
}
```

### 2. The Critical Difference (Polymorphism)

This is the most important part. Method Hiding **breaks** polymorphism.

If you store the Child object inside a variable of type **Parent**, C# will see the **Parent's** method, not the Child's.

C#

```C#
Child c = new Child();
c.Show(); // Output: "Child Show" (As expected)

// --- THE TRAP ---
Parent p = new Child(); // Upcasting
p.Show(); 
// Output: "Parent Show" 
// Because the method was HIDDEN, not OVERRIDDEN.
// The variable 'p' only sees the Parent's version.
```

### 3. Hiding vs. Overriding

|**Feature**|**Overriding (override)**|**Hiding (new)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Parent Keyword**|Must be `virtual`|Can be anything|
|**Child Keyword**|`override`|`new`|
|**Polymorphism**|**Yes.** `Parent p = new Child()` runs **Child** logic.|**No.** `Parent p = new Child()` runs **Parent** logic.|
|**Goal**|**Replace** the parent's logic.|**Create a new** method that happens to have the same name.|

### 4. Compiler Warning

If you write a method in a child class with the same name as the parent but **forget** the `new` keyword, the code will still compile and run (as Method Hiding).

However, Visual Studio will give you a **green warning**:

> _"Keyword 'new' is required on 'Child.Show' because it hides inherited member 'Parent.Show'."_

It assumes you did it by accident. Adding `new` simply tells the compiler: _"Yes, I did this on purpose."_
