## C# Sealed Methods

A **Sealed Method** is a method that **cannot be overridden** any further by classes that inherit from it.

It effectively says: _"I have changed this method, but this is the final version. No subclasses are allowed to change it again."_

### 1. The Rule

You cannot just seal any method. To seal a method, it must meet two criteria:

1. It must be an **`override`** of a parent method.
    
2. You use the keyword sequence **`sealed override`**.
    

> **Note:** You cannot seal a method in a base class directly. If you want to prevent a base method from being overridden, just **don't** mark it as `virtual`!

### 2. Syntax Example

C#

```C#
// 1. GRANDPARENT (Base)
class Animal
{
    // Must be virtual to allow the first override
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal Sound");
    }
}

// 2. PARENT (Derived)
class Dog : Animal
{
    // We override the parent logic, AND we lock it (seal)
    // No class inheriting from Dog can change this now.
    public sealed override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark");
    }
}

// 3. CHILD (Sub-Derived)
class Bulldog : Dog
{
    // ❌ COMPILER ERROR!
    // "cannot override inherited member 'Dog.MakeSound' because it is sealed"
    /*
    public override void MakeSound() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof");
    }
    */
}
```

### 3. Why use it?

1. **Design Intent:** You want to guarantee that a specific behavior remains consistent for all subclasses (e.g., a security check in a login method).
    
2. **Performance:** The compiler can optimize sealed methods slightly better because it knows it doesn't need to look for other versions in subclasses (no v-table lookup).
    

### 4. Sealed Classes vs Sealed Methods

- **`sealed class`**: You cannot inherit from this **class** at all.
    
- **`sealed method`**: You **can** inherit from the class, but you cannot change **this specific method**.
