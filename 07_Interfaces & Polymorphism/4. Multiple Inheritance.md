## C# Multiple Inheritance

This is a common interview question: _"Does C# support Multiple Inheritance?"_

The answer is **No** (for Classes) and **Yes** (for Interfaces).

### 1. The Rule for Classes (The "No")

A class in C# can inherit from only ONE Parent Class.

You cannot say: class Child : Father, Mother.

Why? (The Diamond Problem)

If both Father and Mother have a method called Drive(), and Child inherits from both... which Drive() method does the Child use? To avoid this ambiguity and complexity, C# forbids it.

C#

```C#
class Camera { }
class Phone { }

// ❌ COMPILER ERROR:
// Class 'SmartPhone' cannot have multiple base classes: 'Camera' and 'Phone'
class SmartPhone : Camera, Phone 
{
}
```

### 2. The Solution: Interfaces (The "Yes")

While you can only inherit one Class, you can implement multiple Interfaces.

Since Interfaces are empty contracts (they don't usually have code implementation), there is no conflict.

**Syntax:** `class Child : ParentClass, IInterface1, IInterface2, ...`

C#

```C#
// 1. Parent Class (Inheritance)
public class ElectronicDevice
{
    public void TurnOn() => Console.WriteLine("Power On");
}

// 2. Interfaces (Capabilities)
public interface ICamera
{
    void TakePhoto();
}

public interface IPhone
{
    void MakeCall();
}

// 3. Child Class
// Inherits 1 Class (ElectronicDevice)
// Implements 2 Interfaces (ICamera, IPhone)
public class SmartPhone : ElectronicDevice, ICamera, IPhone
{
    // Must implement Interface methods
    public void TakePhoto() => Console.WriteLine("Click!");
    public void MakeCall()  => Console.WriteLine("Calling...");
}
```

### Summary

|**Type**|**Limit**|**Syntax**|
|---|---|---|
|**Class**|**Max 1**|`class A : B`|
|**Interface**|**Unlimited**|`class A : IOne, ITwo, IThree`|
|**Combined**|1 Class + Many Interfaces|`class A : Base, IOne, ITwo`|
