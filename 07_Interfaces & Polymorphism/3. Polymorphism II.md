Here is the note on **Polymorphism with Interfaces**, specifically focusing on the "Payment Example" mentioned in the video titles.

## C# Polymorphism via Interfaces

We usually think of Polymorphism as "Parent Class vs Child Class" (Inheritance).

However, Interfaces provide a more flexible form of Polymorphism.

Instead of saying "Treat this Dog as an Animal" (Is-A),

We say "Treat this Object as something that can Pay" (Can-Do).

### 1. The Scenario (The Payment Example)

Imagine a store that accepts Credit Cards and PayPal. Later, you might want to add Bitcoin.

If you write code specifically for CreditCard, you have to rewrite the system to add PayPal.

If you use **Interface Polymorphism**, you write the system **once** for `IPayment`, and it works for everything forever.

### 2. The Setup

C#

```
// 1. The Contract
public interface IPayment
{
    void Pay(double amount);
}

// 2. The Implementations (Unrelated classes)
public class CreditCard : IPayment
{
    public void Pay(double amount) => Console.WriteLine($"Card charged: {amount}");
}

public class PayPal : IPayment
{
    public void Pay(double amount) => Console.WriteLine($"PayPal processed: {amount}");
}
```

### 3. Reusability (The Power of Polymorphism)

Here is where the magic happens. We create a method that accepts **The Interface**, not the specific class.

C#

```
public class Shop
{
    // This method is POLYMORPHIC.
    // It doesn't care if you pass a Card, PayPal, or Bitcoin.
    // It only cares that the object implements IPayment.
    public void Checkout(IPayment paymentMethod, double total)
    {
        paymentMethod.Pay(total);
    }
}
```

### 4. Usage

C#

```
Shop myShop = new Shop();

// We can pass different objects to the SAME method
myShop.Checkout(new CreditCard(), 100.50);
myShop.Checkout(new PayPal(), 25.00);
```

### 5. Inheritance Polymorphism vs. Interface Polymorphism

This covers the difference mentioned in Lesson 203.

|**Feature**|**Inheritance (Class)**|**Interface**|
|---|---|---|
|**Relationship**|**"Is-A"** (Strict)<br><br>  <br><br>_A Dog is an Animal._|**"Can-Do"** (Flexible)<br><br>  <br><br>_A Card can Pay. A Phone can Pay._|
|**Coupling**|**High.** Child classes depend heavily on the Parent.|**Low.** Classes don't need to be related at all.|
|**Shared Code**|Child inherits logic/code from Parent.|No code is inherited. Only signatures.|
|**Best For**|Building a hierarchy of related objects.|giving unrelated objects a common capability (e.g., `IPayment`).|

### Summary

- **Inheritance Polymorphism:** "I am an `Animal`, so I can `Eat()`."
    
- **Interface Polymorphism:** "I have an `IPayment` contract, so I can `Pay()`." (It doesn't matter what the object actually _is_).
