Here is the note on **Creating Folders and Managing Directories**.

## C# Managing Folders (`System.IO`)

Beyond just writing files, you often need to organize them into folders (directories).

The Directory class provides static methods to create, check, and delete folders.

**Namespace:** `using System.IO;`

### 1. Creating a Folder

Use `Directory.CreateDirectory()`.

- **Safety:** It is smart. If the folder already exists, it does **nothing** (it won't delete or overwrite your data). It just ensures the path is valid.
    

C#

```C#
string folderName = "MyGameSaves";

// Creates the folder in your .exe directory
Directory.CreateDirectory(folderName);
```

### 2. Checking if a Folder Exists

Before trying to save a file inside a folder, it is good practice to check if the folder exists (though `CreateDirectory` handles this, other operations might need the check).

C#

```C#
if (Directory.Exists(folderName))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Folder already exists.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Folder is missing.");
}
```

### 3. Combining Paths (Crucial Best Practice)

Never manually glue strings together with backslashes like folder + "\\" + file.

Windows uses \, Linux/Mac uses /. If you hardcode it, your app might break on other OSs.

Use **`Path.Combine()`**. It automatically picks the correct separator for the operating system.

C#

```C#
string folder = "Logs";
string file = "error.txt";

// BAD:
// string fullPath = folder + "\\" + file; 

// GOOD: (Becomes "Logs\error.txt" on Windows, "Logs/error.txt" on Mac)
string fullPath = Path.Combine(folder, file);
```

### 4. Full Example: Logging to a Specific Folder

This pattern ensures the folder exists _before_ trying to write the file, preventing a "Directory Not Found" crash.

C#

```C#
public static void SaveLog(string message)
{
    string folder = "AppLogs";
    string fileName = "daily_log.txt";
    
    // 1. Build the path safely
    string fullPath = Path.Combine(folder, fileName);
    
    // 2. Ensure folder exists (Create it if missing)
    Directory.CreateDirectory(folder);
    
    // 3. Write the file inside that folder
    File.AppendAllText(fullPath, message + "\n");
}
```

### 5. Deleting Folders

Be careful!

- **`Delete(path)`**: Only works if the folder is **empty**. Throws error if files are inside.
    
- **`Delete(path, true)`**: **Recursive delete**. Deletes the folder AND all files inside it.
    

C#

```C#
// Delete everything!
if (Directory.Exists("OldLogs"))
{
    Directory.Delete("OldLogs", true); 
}
```
