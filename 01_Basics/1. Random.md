Here is the note on generating random numbers, based on the code you provided.

## C# Random Numbers

C# provides a built-in class for generating pseudo-random numbers.

### 1. The Modern & Preferred Way (using `Random.Shared`)

Starting in .NET 6, the easiest and most reliable method is to use the `Random.Shared` property. This gives you a single, thread-safe instance for your whole application.

C#

```C#
// Gets a random integer from 1 up to (but not including) 11
// The result range is 1-10
int rand = Random.Shared.Next(1, 11);

// If you only provide one argument, it's the 'max' value (exclusive)
// The result range is 0-99
int randZeroBased = Random.Shared.Next(100);

// For a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0
double randDouble = Random.Shared.NextDouble();
```

### 2. The Traditional Way (creating an instance)

You can also create your own instance of the `Random` class. This is still useful, especially if you need a reproducible sequence of numbers (by providing a "seed").

C#

```C#
// 1. Create an instance
Random random = new Random();

// 2. Call the .Next() method
// Gets a random number between 1 and 10
int rand = random.Next(1, 11);
```

### 3. Important: `Next(min, max)` Behavior

The `Next(int minValue, int maxValue)` method is very specific:

- `minValue`: The lower bound is **inclusive** (it can be returned).
    
- `maxValue`: The upper bound is **exclusive** (it will _never_ be returned).
    

C#

```
// random.Next(1, 11)
// Includes: 1
// Excludes: 11
// Possible results: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

### 4. Common Pitfall (Why `Random.Shared` is safer)

**Avoid** creating `new Random()` inside a loop. The `Random` class often uses the system clock to "seed" itself. If the loop runs very fast, it will create multiple instances with the _same seed_, resulting in the _same random number_.

`Random.Shared` solves this problem.

C#

```C#
// BAD: This might print the same number 5 times
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Random badRandom = new Random();
    Console.WriteLine(badRandom.Next(1, 100));
}

// GOOD: This will correctly print 5 different numbers
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(Random.Shared.Next(1, 100));
}
```
